            I am currently wrapping up the last few semesters of my Bachelors in Software Engineering.<br/>
            At the same time, I am also taking classes to begin my path towards growing my knowledge of mechanical systems, robotics and artificial intelligence.<br/>
            I have yet to decide if this will be done through aquiring an associates, certification, masters or by just taking supplemental classes...Stay Tuned!<br/>
