            I am currently wrapping up the last few semesters of my Bachelors in Software Engineering.<br/>
            At the same time, I am also taking classes to begin my path towards growing my knowledge of mechanical systems, robotics and artificial intelligence.<br/>
            I have yet to decide if this will be don through aquiring an associates, certification, masters or by just taking supplemental classes.<br/>
            If you have any advice on this I am happy to take any advice I can get on the matter.<br/>
            I am predominantly looking for something that can be taken remotely or in the Reno/Sparks Nevada area.<br/>
