            I am currently wrapping up the last few semesters of my Bachelors in Software Engineering.
            At the same time, I am also taking classes to begin my path towards growing my knowledge of mechanical systems, robotics and artificial intelligence.
            I have yet to decide if this will be don through aquiring an associates, certification, masters or by just taking supplemental classes.
            If you have any advice on this I am happy to take any advice I can get on the matter.
            I am predominantly looking for something that can be taken remotely or in the Reno/Sparks Nevada area.
