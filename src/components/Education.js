            This past May 2023 I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering.<br />
            I recently began a Systems Engineering Certification progam and am hoping to begin gradschool this upcoming Fall 2024.
            Some other areas that I am actively working on learning more about are Linux, Computer Aided Design, and Cybersecurity.<p />
