            I graduated May 2023 with my Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering with a concentration in Application Development.
            I am currently enrolled in a Systems Engineering Certification progam and am hoping to begin gradschool this upcoming Fall 2024.
            Some other areas that I am actively working on learning more about are Linux, Computer Aided Design, and Cybersecurity.  <br />
